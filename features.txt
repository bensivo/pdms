Must have features:
- Add ability to bulk-edit a bunch of records of the same type, in a spreadsheet view 
- Button to delete a record
- Add "list" field types, lists of text items, lists of numbers, lists of references, lists of options
- create a separate 'backlog' view , which allows users to add a bunch of entites, then order them in some way. 
    - For sprint planning, backlog grooming
- Add a backend

Nice to have features:
- Export and import to/from excel or CSV
- Split panel view, instead of just a table
- Make table columns resizable
- in the entity-list page, if showign a backlink type, let the user expand the list somehow to see all of them?
