- The "Display Field" lets you choose refernces and backlinks

- The 'long text' input field isn't actaully very long

- Setting 'number' in a field type doesn't restrict the input in add record

- refernce inputs are selects, not typable selects. Could get unwieldy

- Search input in entity-list page doesn't search by reference names
