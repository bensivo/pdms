# Project Overview

> Most applications are just interfaces for managing data

PDMS is exactly what its name suggests a "Personal Data Management System". Inspired by concept above, it aims to make data management easier. 

The idea for PDMS came from the realization that most business applications ERPs, CRMs, CMSs, are all essentially the same thing - an interface for managing entities, with some views and workflows catered to specific job functions. 

- An ERP stores projects, people, finances, and has opinionated views and workflows for managers and accountants
- A CRM stores opportunities, leads, accounts, and has opinionated views and workflows for sales teams.
- A CDP stores leads, users, segments, and interactions, and has opinionated views and workflwos for marketing teams. 
- A Project Tracker stores projects, tasks, teams, and has opinionated views and workflows for engineering teams. 


The goal of PDMS is to make all of these workflows possible within a single application, and allow users to hyper-customize the tool to their specific needs.
